# teenyat

A virtual machine/assembler for a simple imaginary architecture called TeenyAT.

The architecture design is by Professor [Amos Confer](https://sunypoly.edu/faculty-and-staff/william-amos-confer) for CS 220 at SUNY Poly from the fall semester 2020. All of the code was written by me (Eric McHugh).
